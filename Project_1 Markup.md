# High Concept
---
* Think the wikipedia searching game but with searching for the worst performance site.
* The goal is to find the website with the worst performance. Using google's website that evaluates the performance of a website.


# Genre
---
* I don't think there's much of a genre here maybe you could call it indie.
* It's definitely multiplayer probably local for now.
* I would also define it as competitive.


# Platform
---
* Anything with a screen or keyboard(computer, phone, tablet, etc)

# Story
---
* There is no real story for the game but the purpose behind it is to find the worst website you can in under 1 minute. Possibly making rounds so you can't use the same website over and over.

# Aesthetics
---
* Pretty simple graphics maybe 8 bit or cartoony characters.
* Sound will also be simple maybe some sort of "You won!" sound and a "You lose!" sound
* Layout will be pretty simple two boxes one for each player along with an area to submit the URL.
* Point/Round total at the top.

# Gameplay
---
* Player has a 1 minute timer ticking with a box to submit that url
* They will be given a score after they submit their URL based off how bad the website's performance is.
